APBQ-F,"Appropriate Pain Behavior Questionnaire - Female (APBQ-F): Assesses pain beliefs regarding females. A 14-item questionnaire that measures beliefs about the appropriateness of expressing pain in the presence of others. Eight items on the ABPQ express a positive attitude to pain expression, and 6 express a negative attitude towards expressing pain. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with each of the 14 statements by scoring them on a 7-point Likert scale. APBQ was scored by calculating the difference between the mean score of the eight positive statements and six negative statements. The final score has a bounded range -6 to +6, with negative values indicating a bias against females expressing pain behaviours."
APBQ-M,Appropriate Pain Behavior Questionnaire - Male (APBQ-M): Assesses pain beliefs regarding males. See ABPQ-F for details.
