# Random forest analysis of predictors of pain tolerance and beliefs

## Description
The primary content of this repository includes the [data](/data/random-forest.csv), [codebook](/data/codebook-random-forest.csv), and analysis scripts (with associated markdown outputs and plots) for random forest analyses of predictors of cold-pain tolerance ([cold-pain-tolerance.Rmd](cold-pain-tolerance.Rmd), [cold-pain-tolerance.md](cold-pain-tolerance.md)), pressure-pain tolerance ([pressure-pain-tolerance.Rmd](pressure-pain-tolerance.Rmd), [pressure-pain-tolerance.md](pressure-pain-tolerance.md)), and acceptance of pain behaviours in males ([apbq-male.Rmd](apbq-male.Rmd), [apbq-male.md](apbq-male.md)) in healthy black (self-declared African ancestry) and white (self-declared European ancestry) young adults of both sexes in South Africa. Only complete cases were used in the random forest analysis (pain tolerances: 156/212 participants; ABPQ-M: 167/212 participants). 

The repository also includes the [data](/data/bivariate-data.csv) and [codebook](/data/codebook-bivariate-data.csv) used in all bivariate analyses. These analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 6.0, and the results have not been uploaded to the repository (please contact [antonia.wadley@wits.ac.za](mailto:antonia.wadley@wits.ac.za) or [peter.kamerman@wits.ac.za](mailto:peter.kamerman@wits.ac.za) for more information).

## Overview of the study
###Background
Studies on relationships between sex, ethnicity and pain largely have emanated from the US and Europe. We compared cold (CPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PPT) in male and female South Africans of African and European ancestry and assessed whether psychosocial factors (including pain beliefs) predicted differences in pain tolerance.
 
### Methods
We recruited 106 (62 female) students of African ancestry and 106 (55 female) of European ancestry and subjected them to a cold-pressor test and pressure algometry. Socioeconomic status (SES), pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety and pain beliefs were assessed as predictors of pain tolerance.
 
### Results
CPT was lower in students of African compared to European ancestry (for both sexes), and PPT was lower in female than male students (for both ethnicities). Females were very  accepting of men expressing pain and males less so.  Males of African ancestry were least accepting but still tolerant. Multivariate analysis identified African ancestry, and particularly being a female of African ancestry as strong predictors of lower CPT. Anxiety was a weak predict of CPT. Sex was the only strong predictor of PPT on multivariate analysis (PPT females < males) and catastrophizing was a weak predictor . Female sex and African ancestry were strong predictors of acceptance of expression of pain in males. SES was a weak predictor of APBQ-M.
 
### Conclusions
Despite a different cultural and social background from US and European cohorts, we saw similar patterns of sex and ethnic differences in CPT and PPT in an African cohort. Traditional psychosocial predictors of pain sensitivity predicted variation in the outcome variables but were not strong predictors.

Participants rated the extent to which they had experienced symptoms within the last week on a 4-point Likert scale. A mean subscale scores > 1.75 indicates clinically relevant levels of anxiety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|

| PCS        	| Pain Catastrophizing Scale was used to assess catastrophic thinking related to pain. The PCS was administered before exposure to the experimental pain stimuli to determine trait catastrophizing: Assesses the general tendency to catastrophize. Participants rated each of the 13 items on the questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale. PCS scores > 30 indicate a clinically significant level of catastrophizing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| APBQ-F     	| Appropriate Pain Behavior Questionnaire - Female (APBQ-F): Assesses pain beliefs regarding females. A 14-item questionnaire that measures beliefs about the appropriateness of expressing pain in the presence of others. Eight items on the ABPQ express a positive attitude to pain expression, and 6 express a negative attitude towards expressing pain. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with each of the 14 statements by scoring them on a 7-point Likert scale. APBQ was scored by calculating the difference between the mean score of the eight positive statements and six negative statements. The final score has a bounded range -6 to +6, with negative values indicating a bias against females expressing pain behaviours. 	|

**Note:**
The dataset does not contain any calculated scores. To calculate:  

1. Socio-economic assest score:  
    - Based on ownership of culturally relevant assets     (refrigerator, televison, car, washing machine, microwave oven). Because the cohort consisted of full-time students we used parental/guardian ownership of material household items as proxies for participants’ asset ownership. The score was calculated by summing the number of assests 'owned', and dividing by the number of asset questions correctly completed.  

2. Pain Catastrophizing Scale score:  
    - Scores from each of the 13 statements were summed (the maximum score is 52 with a higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize. PCS scores > 30 indicate a clinically significant level of catastrophizing).  

3. Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25:  
    - Mean scores for the 10-item anxiety subscale and the 15-item depression subscale items were calculated (mean subscale scores > 1.75 indicate clinically relevant levels of anxiety or depression).

5. Appropriate Pain Behaviours Questionnaire score:  
    - The Appropriate Pain Behavior Questionnaire (APBQ) was
used to assess pain beliefs (Nayak et al., 2000). The questionnaire is a 14-item questionnaire that measures beliefs about the appropriateness of expressing pain in the presence of others. There are two components to the APBQ: the APBQ-Male (APBQ-M), which assesses how appropriate individuals find men expressing pain to be and the APBQ-Female (APBQ-F), which assesses how appropriate individuals find women expressing pain to be. Eight items on the ABPQ express a positive attitude to pain expression, and 6 express a negative attitude towards expressing pain. The APBQ score was calculated by taking the difference between the mean score of the eight statements that assess whether it is appropriate to express pain behaviors and the mean score of the six statements that assess whether it is inappropriate to express pain behaviors. The final score has a bounded range -6 to +6, with negative values indicating a bias towards pain expression being considered inappropriate and positive values indicating a bias towards pain expression being considered appropriate. We interpreted a score close to zero as indicating an individual had a neutral view of pain expression.
