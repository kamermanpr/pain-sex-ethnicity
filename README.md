# Random forest analysis of predictors of pain tolerance and beliefs

## Description
The primary content of this repository includes the [data](/data/random-forest.csv), [codebook](/data/codebook-random-forest.csv), and analysis scripts (with associated markdown outputs and plots) for random forest analyses of predictors of cold-pain tolerance ([cold-pain-tolerance.Rmd](cold-pain-tolerance.Rmd), [cold-pain-tolerance.md](cold-pain-tolerance.md)), pressure-pain tolerance ([pressure-pain-tolerance.Rmd](pressure-pain-tolerance.Rmd), [pressure-pain-tolerance.md](pressure-pain-tolerance.md)), and acceptance of pain behaviours in males ([apbq-male.Rmd](apbq-male.Rmd), [apbq-male.md](apbq-male.md)) in healthy black and white young adults of both sexes in South Africa. Only complete cases were used in the random forest analysis (pain tolerances: 156/212 participants; ABPQ-M: 167/212 participants). 

The repository also includes the [data](/data/bivariate-data.csv) and [codebook](/data/codebook-bivariate-data.csv) used in all bivariate analyses. These analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 6.0, and the results have not been uploaded to the repository (please contact [antonia.wadley@wits.ac.za](mailto:antonia.wadley@wits.ac.za) or [peter.kamerman@wits.ac.za](mailto:peter.kamerman@wits.ac.za) for more information).

## Overview of the study
### Background
Sex and race influence pain sensitivity and pain beliefs.  However, studies on relationships between sex, race and pain largely have emanated from the US and Europe. 

### Objectives
To determine effects of sex and race on pain sensitivity and beliefs in a black African population we compared cold and pressure pain tolerance in male and female black and white South Africans. We also assessed whether psychosocial factors (including pain beliefs) predicted sex and race differences in pain sensitivity and beliefs.

### Methods 
We recruited 106 black (62 female, 44 male) and 106 white (55 female, 51 male) students. Participants underwent a cold-pressor test and pressure algometry to determine tolerance to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Socioeconomic status, pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety and pain beliefs were assessed as predictors of differences in pain tolerance. 

### Results
Cold pain tolerance was lower in black than white students (for both sexes), and pressure pain tolerance was lower in female than male students (for both races). Pain intensity at tolerance was similar for all groups in both tests. Men were less accepting of men expressing pain than were women, with black males being the least accepting. Regression tree analysis identified that being black, and particularly being a black female predicted lower cold pain tolerance. Anxiety and ownership of assets (as a measure of socioeconomic status) were identified as additional variables of interest for predicting cold pain tolerance on random forest analysis but the associations were borderline. Both regression tree and random forest analysis identified female sex as the only significant predictor of pressure-pain tolerance, with females having lower pressure-pain tolerance than men. Regression tree analysis identified sex and race as important predictors of APBQ-M score, such that being female predicted greater APBQ-M scores, and amongst males, being black predicted significantly lower APBQ-M scores than did being white. Random forest also identified depression and ownership of assets as variables of interest.

### Conclusions
Despite a different cultural and social background from US and European cohorts, we saw similar patterns of sex and race differences in tolerance to cold and pressure stimuli in an African cohort. Traditional psychosocial predictors of pain sensitivity were identified as being of interest but were not strongly associated.

| PCS        	| Pain Catastrophizing Scale was used to assess catastrophic thinking related to pain. The PCS was administered before exposure to the experimental pain stimuli to determine trait catastrophizing: Assesses the general tendency to catastrophize. Participants rated each of the 13 items on the questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale. PCS scores > 30 indicate a clinically significant level of catastrophizing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| APBQ-F     	| Appropriate Pain Behavior Questionnaire - Female (APBQ-F): Assesses pain beliefs regarding females. A 14-item questionnaire that measures beliefs about the appropriateness of expressing pain in the presence of others. Eight items on the ABPQ express a positive attitude to pain expression, and 6 express a negative attitude towards expressing pain. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with each of the 14 statements by scoring them on a 7-point Likert scale. APBQ was scored by calculating the difference between the mean score of the eight positive statements and six negative statements. The final score has a bounded range -6 to +6, with negative values indicating a bias against females expressing pain behaviours. 	|

**Note:**
The dataset does not contain any calculated scores. To calculate:  

1. Socio-economic assest score:  
    - Based on ownership of culturally relevant assets     (refrigerator, televison, car, washing machine, microwave oven). Because the cohort consisted of full-time students we used parental/guardian ownership of material household items as proxies for participants’ asset ownership. The score was calculated by summing the number of assests 'owned', and dividing by the number of asset questions correctly completed.  

2. Pain Catastrophizing Scale score:  
    - Scores from each of the 13 statements were summed (the maximum score is 52 with a higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize. PCS scores > 30 indicate a clinically significant level of catastrophizing).  

3. Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25:  
    - Mean scores for the 10-item anxiety subscale and the 15-item depression subscale items were calculated (mean subscale scores > 1.75 indicate clinically relevant levels of anxiety or depression).

5. Appropriate Pain Behaviours Questionnaire score:  
    - The Appropriate Pain Behavior Questionnaire (APBQ) was
used to assess pain beliefs (Nayak et al., 2000). The questionnaire is a 14-item questionnaire that measures beliefs about the appropriateness of expressing pain in the presence of others. There are two components to the APBQ: the APBQ-Male (APBQ-M), which assesses how appropriate individuals find men expressing pain to be and the APBQ-Female (APBQ-F), which assesses how appropriate individuals find women expressing pain to be. Eight items on the ABPQ express a positive attitude to pain expression, and 6 express a negative attitude towards expressing pain. The APBQ score was calculated by taking the difference between the mean score of the eight statements that assess whether it is appropriate to express pain behaviors and the mean score of the six statements that assess whether it is inappropriate to express pain behaviors. The final score has a bounded range -6 to +6, with negative values indicating a bias towards pain expression being considered inappropriate and positive values indicating a bias towards pain expression being considered appropriate. We interpreted a score close to zero as indicating an individual had a neutral view of pain expression.
