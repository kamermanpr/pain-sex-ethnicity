## Overview of the study
### Background
Sex and race influence pain sensitivity and pain beliefs. However, studies on relationships between sex, race and pain largely have emanated from the US and Europe. 

### Objectives
To determine effects of sex and race on pain sensitivity and beliefs in a black African population we compared cold and pressure pain tolerance in male and female black and white South Africans. We also assessed whether psychosocial factors (including pain beliefs) predicted sex and race differences in pain sensitivity and beliefs. 

### Methods
We recruited 108 black (64 female, 44 male) and 108 white (64 female, 52 male) students. Participants underwent a cold-pressor test (hand submersion in ice-water) and pressure algometry (pressure applied to nail-bed of index finger) to determine tolerance to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Socioeconomic status, catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), depression and anxiety (25-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist), and pain beliefs (Appropriate Pain Beliefs Questionnaire) were assessed as predictors of sex and race differences in pain tolerance. 

### Results
Cold pain tolerance was lower in black than white students (for both sexes), and pressure pain tolerance was lower in female than male students (for both races). Pain intensity at tolerance was similar for all groups in both tests. Men were less accepting of men expressing pain than were women, with black males being the least accepting. Multivariate analysis didnâ€™t identify any psychosocial factors as predictors of pain tolerance independently of sex and race. 

### Conclusion
Despite a different cultural and social background from US and European cohorts, we saw similar patterns of sex and race differences in tolerance to cold and pressure stimuli in an African cohort. However, traditional psychosocial predictors of pain sensitivity were not apparent in this group.
